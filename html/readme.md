The covid tracker for University of Porto is intended to be a spread-chain tool to indentify contaminations from Covid-19 and stop it as soon as possible. Members of the comunity use their university id number to register and login in to the website. There, if they are students, they can check their attendance log, see what classes theyre enrolled in and report that they've tested positive for coronavirus, in which case they'll mark the day they got tested and mark a box confirming they understand they're are responsible for the truthfulness of the information they've inserted. Everyone who has been in the same lecture (even professors) as a confirmed sick person in the 10 days prior to their test gets a notification on there page and they're personal area turns orange, instructing them to contact SNS. Professors can check the same feature of reporting that they've tested positive and, on top of that, they can manually insert the attendance for their students, in case they haven't swiped their cards in the classroom - all they have to do is insert the date and time of the class, the classroom and the id of the student. The website has a sidebar with a menu where students can consult and search all faculties at U. Porto and redirect to their institutional websites, a tab where they can consult all the existing degrees, courses and classes from the database. Furthermore, there is a schedule section, with the occurrences of every class in the database and a help section, that briefly explains the website.
